# ðŸ“„ RAG QA Evaluation Questions â€“ NTT Data 2024 Case Book

This document contains a set of evaluation questions grouped into three difficulty levels. These are designed to test the effectiveness of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built on top of the **NTT Data 2024 Case Book**.

## ðŸŸ¢ Easy Questions
> These answers are directly stated in the chunks and can be found word-for-word or nearly word-for-word.

1. What percentage of manufacturing companies have implemented digital transformation aimed at optimizing overall manufacturing functions?
2. What is causing the acceleration of population decline in Japan?
3. What are the main goals of the Smart AI Agent project?
4. Which AI approach was used to support medical staff in identifying anomalies in patient behavior?
5. What was the reported productivity improvement after implementing the Smart AI Agent?

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Questions
> These answers require some inference or contextual understanding. They are not exact matches to any sentence in the chunks but are answerable based on them.

1. Why might Japanese companies lag behind the US in adopting generative AI despite its known productivity benefits?
2. How does the Smart Factory project contribute to solving issues caused by declining labor force?
3. What role does AI play in addressing social issues related to aging populations?
4. In what ways does digital transformation affect operational efficiency in manufacturing settings?
5. Why is it important to detect subtle changes in patient behavior in elderly care using AI?

## ðŸ”´ Hard Questions
> These are intentionally unanswerable from the chunks. They test the modelâ€™s hallucination behavior and boundary reasoning.

1. What ethical challenges might arise from deploying Smart AI Agents in the workplace?
2. How would the implementation of similar AI agents differ in countries with higher generative AI adoption rates than Japan?
3. What impact could Smart Factories have on employment levels in traditional manufacturing roles?
4. How might cultural factors in Japan influence the slower adoption of AI technologies?
5. Could generative AI be used to solve healthcare staffing shortages outside of Japan?
