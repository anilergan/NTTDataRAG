### 8. Why is AI-based breeding management considered necessary in Japan’s pig farming industry?

**Real Answer:**  
Because Japan’s pig farming sector is facing labor shortages due to aging breeders, and high dependency on skilled experience for tasks like estrus detection. AI-based systems like PIG LABO® provide automated, data-driven breeding support, reducing the number of skilled workers required while maintaining high productivity and minimizing stress on animals.

**📄 Source:** `sr_2022_cb_v_split.pdf` | **Page:** 20

**Model's Answer Evaluation**  
**Model's Answer:** AI-based breeding management is considered necessary in Japan's pig farming industry for several key reasons:

1. Aging Workforce: The pig farming sector in Japan faces a significant challenge due to the aging of skilled and experienced pig breeders. As these individuals retire, there is a risk of losing valuable breeding knowledge and techniques.

2. Labor Load Reduction: The industry is experiencing an increase in the number of pigs per household, leading to larger-scale operations. This has resulted in a heavier labor load for breeding staff. AI can help reduce this burden by automating certain tasks, such as monitoring estrus in female pigs.

3. Skill Transfer: AI-based systems like PIG LABO® aim to replicate the expertise of skilled workers, allowing less experienced staff to achieve breeding results comparable to those of seasoned professionals. This helps in transferring breeding techniques and knowledge effectively.

4. Efficiency Improvements: AI can analyze data collected from the piggery environment and pig behavior, enabling high-precision breeding management. This leads to improved efficiency in operations, including better feed and energy consumption, which enhances the sustainability of the pig farming industry.

5. Stress Reduction for Pigs: By utilizing AI for monitoring and management, the stress on pigs during the growing process can be minimized, contributing to better animal welfare and overall productivity.

6. Stable Production Levels: AI-driven management can help maintain stable production levels that are less dependent on the skill level of individual workers, ensuring a consistent supply of pork in Japan, which is increasingly important given the country's reliance on pork imports.

Overall, the integration of AI in breeding management is seen as a crucial step to address the challenges faced by the pig farming industry in Japan, ensuring sustainability, efficiency, and a stable supply of pork.
- ✅ **Accuracy:** Correct and well-expanded. Covers key drivers such as aging labor, reduced workload, need for knowledge transfer, and precision breeding.

### 9. Why did the new BSI requirements initially lead to a significant increase in CPU load?

**Real Answer:**  
Because the BSI requirements mandated longer bit key lengths for digital certificates, which doubled the size of signatures and caused extensive computational overhead, resulting in a twofold increase in CPU load and higher energy usage.

**📄 Source:** `sr_2023_cb_v.pdf` | **Page:** 8

**Model's Answer Evaluation**
**Model's Answer:** The new BSI requirements led to a significant increase in CPU load because they mandated the replacement of digital certificates with longer bit key lengths, which were approximately twice the original size. This increase in key length required more extensive processing tasks to secure data, resulting in a twofold increase in CPU load and a corresponding rise in power consumption.

- ✅ **Accuracy:** Fully correct — model accurately mentions key length doubling, signature size, increased processing, and power usage.
- 🧠 **Reasoning Quality:** Very good — clear technical understanding of cause-effect relationship from regulation to system impact.
- ⭐ **Best Similarity:** 0.58
**🔎 Verdict:** **9 / 10**

### 10. Why does NTT DATA believe collaboration across startups, local governments, and large corporations is essential in the healthcare sector?

**Real Answer:**  
Because the healthcare market is diversifying with needs like advanced medical tech, regional healthcare, diet, exercise, and sleep. Startups need support while large companies seek efficiency. Yet, there are few platforms for effective user verification and collaboration. NTT DATA’s Co-Creation Lab aims to bridge this gap.

**📄 Source:** `sr_2024_cb_v.pdf` | **Page:** 47

**Model's Answer Evaluation**
**Model's Answer:** NTT DATA believes collaboration across startups, local governments, and large corporations is essential in the healthcare sector for several reasons:

1. **Diverse Expertise and Resources**: Different stakeholders bring unique strengths to the table. Startups often have innovative ideas and agility, while large corporations can provide substantial resources and established networks. Local governments can offer insights into community health needs and regulatory frameworks. Collaborating allows for a more comprehensive approach to developing healthcare solutions.

2. **Expanding Healthcare Market**: The healthcare market is rapidly expanding, with increasing demands for diverse services ranging from personal health management to advanced medical technologies. Collaboration helps stakeholders address these varied needs more effectively by pooling their resources and expertise.

3. **Streamlining R&D**: Large companies are looking to reduce research and development costs and time, while startups seek funding and support for business expansion. Collaborative efforts can lead to more efficient R&D processes, allowing for faster development and deployment of new healthcare services.

4. **User Verification**: When developing new services or products, it is crucial to verify them with actual users. Collaboration provides a platform for companies to access verification sites and users more easily, facilitating the testing and refinement of new healthcare solutions.

5. **Addressing Health Management Trends**: With a growing focus on health management, driven by increased awareness of diet, exercise, and sleep, collaboration is key to creating AI and digital technology-driven services that meet these emerging demands.

Overall, NTT DATA sees collaboration as a way to foster innovation, enhance service delivery, and ultimately improve the health and well-being of individuals in society.
- ✅ **Accuracy:** High — model expands on the rationale with correct context such as startup needs, user verification, and healthcare diversification.
- 🧠 **Reasoning Quality:** Strong — answer builds a clear case with logical structuring across multiple reasons.
- ⭐ **Best Similarity:** 0.67

**🔎 Verdict:** **8.5 / 10**  
Excellent conceptual understanding, but retrieval system isn't prioritizing the most relevant chunk even when the answer is directly present in the file.
