For this reason, early detection of patients in areas where access to medical care is difficult is important for ensuring TB’s eradication. Amid a global shortage of radiologists who use medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, to make diagnoses, NTTDATA has been working to develop diagnostic imaging technology that uses AI to analyze a wide variety of lesions from patient X-ray images, to help physicians with their diagnoses. We have also been field-testing the results of our R&D at hospitals around the world. Utilizing knowledge thus acquired, in January 2021 we started providing free TB diagnostic screening in India, which has the largest number of TB patients in the world, using screening vehicles equipped with AI diagnostic imaging technology. When screening, patients suspected of having TB identified by AI immediately after being X-rayed are encouraged to undergo further TB testing (sputum examination), which leads to early detection of the disease.
